# Predict Customer Churn

- Project **Predict Customer Churn** of ML DevOps Engineer Nanodegree Udacity

## Project Description

This machine learning project trains a logistic and a random forest classifier that can be used
to identify credit card customers that are most likely to churn. The models that 
are trained are found in the 'models' folder. 

Some analysis on the data used to train the models can be found in the folder 
'images/eda'. Reports related to the performance of the two classifiers can be found in 
the folder 'images/results'.

The data used for training the models and performing the analysis must be saved in 
'data/bank_data.csv'. The data currently used come from data available from 
[Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/sakshigoyal7/credit-card-customers?select=BankChurners.csv). 
Data are expected to have the same format as the one found in the Kaggle csv file.


## Running Files

Running the following command will test the functions used, run the code and log errors in 'logs/churn_library.log':
$ python churn_script_logging_and_tests.py

All the functions used for the project are found in the 'churn_library.py' file.
